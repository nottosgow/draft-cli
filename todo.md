## Status

1. i have the round robin working
2. i have selection interface working - 
    a.  the program asks for maunual entry of the number of chutiye playing
    b. the number of players we're drafting
    c. goes around in a round robin style asking to enter the teams and picks

### storage system

currently saving using json files. 

i'm thinking creating a file name with the following attributes would be useful:
    - names of the chutiye playing
    - date of creation of the draft


## todo

1. get persistence (storage) [done]
2. create a storage system
3. a pretty output of the teams
